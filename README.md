# Machine Learning Case Study - Credit Card Consumption Prediction

Analytics plays a pivotal role across industries, leveraging various technological platforms to gather insights from diverse data sources and decipher customer preferences. The credit card industry is no exception, being rich in data that offers invaluable insights into consumer behavior. Analyzing data from credit card transactions provides valuable insights into consumer spending habits and patterns.

By understanding these patterns, companies can tailor marketing campaigns to directly target consumer behavior, resulting in improved sales and revenue growth. Additionally, understanding individual consumer consumption patterns is crucial for effective customer relationship management. This understanding enables banks to personalize services for consumers and devise strategic marketing plans. Therefore, studying the relationship between consumer characteristics and their consumption patterns is essential for driving business success in the credit card industry.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis. The preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values by imputing or dropping them based on the context.
- Encoding categorical variables to numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.
- Handling outliers by removing them or applying appropriate transformations.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.


## Feature Engineering
Several new features are created or existing features are transformed to improve model performance. Feature engineering steps include:

- Creating new features such as total credit card transactions, total debit card transactions, and average transaction amount.
- Transforming existing features to extract relevant information or improve interpretability.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project conducts exploratory data analysis to gain insights from the dataset. EDA tasks include:

- Visualizing the distribution of credit card consumption and other relevant features.
- Analyzing correlations between features to identify important predictors.
- Exploring relationships between demographic variables and credit card consumption.


## Model Building
Various machine learning models are built and evaluated to predict credit card consumption. Model building steps include:

- Selecting appropriate algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
- Tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model performance.
- Evaluating models using appropriate metrics such as Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE).
- Assessing model performance on the testing set to ensure generalization.

## Conclusion

This project aims to predict credit card consumption for individual customers using machine learning techniques. By preprocessing the data, engineering relevant features, conducting exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models, the project aims to provide insights into customer spending behavior. The findings from this analysis can help banks tailor their marketing strategies, personalize services, and improve customer relationship management.
